# Stack Overflow 2020 Survey

## Motivation
This is regarding Udacity Nanodegree Program and for this I have picked up Stack Overflow 2020 Developer Survey. I found this survey data useful and easy for beginner.

## CRISP-DM Steps
This is important steps to involve the data analysis process, which is CRISP-DM. CRISP-DM stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. CRISP-DM has 6 stages:

### 1. Business Understanding:
Looking at the stackoverflow survey data, these are my questions:
- Is There a Difference in The Number of Men and Women Developers?
- What are The Top 10 Countries That did The Survey of Stack Overflow in 2020?
- What are The Most Pogramming Languages Worked in United States?

### 2. Data Understanding:
There is many columns in survey dataset. But for giving answers of our question what data will be used. This part understand as Data understanding.

### 3. Prepare Data:
To doing analysis for the questions, we need to handle missing data and mold the data according to our requirement.

### 4. Data Modeling:
In this step we try different algorithm with training dataset and see which model best fit in our situation.

### 5. Evaluate:
The analysis of the chosen model, we need to check the Accuracy, Precision Matrix, Confusion Matrix or Mean Square Root Error based on the chosen algorithm.

### 6. Deploy:
Once we are ready with our model, the final stage is deployment. 

## Prerequiste:
- Python
- libraries which needs to be installed (Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib)
